Can anyone hear me? I can't see anymore, am I alone? I can't move either, can I even talk or am I just thinking? If so what can I do, I am just a consciousness lost in a black 
void, is that what death feels like? If so it's lonely, well, if anyone can hear me, i'd like to get out of this situation.
